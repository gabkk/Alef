A Defi Scholarship Funding Program

The idea is to provide a platform for sponsors to lock in their capital in Compound and fund the tuition fees of smart and dedicated students with the generated interest.

Which is by the way, how many scholarship programs work in traditional finance except this protocol won’t require any approvals from bureaucrats and financial institutions AND of course, it’s gonna be global!
