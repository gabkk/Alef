Alef is a Scholarship Funding Program running on top of the Compound defi protocol.

The idea is to provide a platform for sponsors to lock in their capital in Compound and fund the tuition fees of smart and dedicated students with the generated interest which is by the way, how many scholarship programs work in traditional finance except this protocol won’t require any approvals from bureaucrats and financial institutions AND of course, it’s gonna be global!

Participants:
    • Sponsers
    • Academies 
    • Students
 
Dynamics: 
    • Students are chosen by sponsors and academies. //off-chain
    • Academies present their offers to the sponsors.
    • An offer includes the gifted online course and its corresponding amount of capital to be locked (The principal).
    • The principal is calculated using this formula:
    
                               Principal = Monthly tuition fees / Interest rate
                               
    Since Compound's interest rate changes over time, the principle has to also follow and be updated each month.
    
    • Once an offer is accepted by the sponsor, the funds will be transferred from his/her address to Compound and a scholarship is           created for a student. //In the future, sponsors could raise funds by joining pools and fulfilling academies' offers collectively.
    • Interest in Compound is generated in real-time and transferred to an academy's address.
    • To ensure that the student is worthy of the scholarship, she has to take a quiz each month.
    • If she fails a quiz she gets a warning from the academy. After a certain amount of warnings, the academy can choose to close the           contract and lockout the sponsor’s money.  //Quizzes and warnings can be done off-chain I suppose
    • After passing a certain amount of quizzes and maybe a final exam she will graduate and the sponsor’s funds will be locked out of         Compound and transferred back to the sponsor's address.
